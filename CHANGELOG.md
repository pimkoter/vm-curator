# Changelog

**v1.4.0**

- **Physical Disk Passthrough as Boot Device** (#80): Whole physical disks
  (NVMe, SATA/HDD, USB) can now be passed straight through to guests — both at
  creation time and on existing VMs — enabling near-native disk performance and
  booting existing bare-metal installs inside a VM.
  - The creation wizard's disk step gains a third mode, **Physical Disk**, with
    a dedicated picker that lists host disks (model, size, bus, stable
    `/dev/disk/by-id` path) and refuses — with the reason shown — the host
    system disk, anything mounted, swap members, and LVM/LUKS/RAID members.
    Selecting a disk requires an explicit typed confirmation naming the exact
    device; Enter and mouse clicks deliberately cancel.
  - New **Passthrough Disks** management screen attaches/detaches whole disks on
    existing VMs via a marker-managed `launch.sh` section (like USB/shared
    folders), with a per-disk firmware **boot index** and `-boot menu=on` while
    any passthrough disk is attached. The USB Passthrough screen gains the same
    boot-index option (`b`), finally making passed-through USB drives bootable.
  - Disks are attached as raw virtio-blk with `cache=none`, referenced by stable
    by-id paths. Generated scripts refuse to start if the disk is missing, not
    readable/writable (with `usermod -aG disk`/udev hints), or has mounted
    partitions.
  - Safety fixes underneath: parsed drives are now role-tagged (system /
    firmware / media), so qcow2 OVMF firmware (as shipped by Fedora) no longer
    makes a raw-disk VM look snapshot-capable — previously **Reset VM could
    delete the firmware image**. Reset and the existing-disk copy/move path now
    refuse block devices outright.
- **Virtual Network Manager** (#53): Create, edit, start/stop, and delete
  managed virtual networks from a new **Networks** screen (`n` on the main menu)
  — no more dropping to the CLI to build lab topologies.
  - Two types: **NAT** (outbound internet via a dedicated, cleanly-removable
    nftables table; iptables fallback) and **Isolated** (host-only, with
    explicit forward-drop rules so it stays isolated even if something else
    enabled IP forwarding). Subnet is configurable; gateway and DHCP range are
    derived. Optional DHCP runs dnsmasq in DHCP-only mode (no DNS — it cannot
    fight systemd-resolved or libvirt on port 53). `/etc/qemu/bridge.conf` ACL
    entries are added on start and removed on stop.
  - The TUI never modifies host networking itself: each network's
    `net-up.sh`/`net-down.sh` live under
    `~/.config/vm-curator/networks/<name>/`, are regenerated on every edit, and
    run with explicit sudo in a terminal — inspectable, and equally usable by
    hand or from boot scripts.
  - Managed networks appear in the per-VM Network Settings bridge picker (even
    while stopped), and launching a VM whose bridge doesn't exist now fails fast
    with a pointer to the Networks screen instead of a cryptic bridge-helper
    error. Coexists cleanly with libvirt (`vmc-` prefix, own dnsmasq and
    firewall table). Deferred to a future release: physical-NIC bridging,
    multi-NIC VMs, autostart.
- **Homebrew Tap for Atomic Distros** (#77): vm-curator is now installable with
  `brew install mroboff/tap/vm-curator` — aimed at immutable distros like
  Bluefin/Silverblue where Homebrew is the preferred CLI package manager. The
  formula (at [mroboff/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/mroboff/homebrew-tap))
  installs the prebuilt release binary (needs only glibc ≥ 2.34 and libudev), is
  bumped automatically by the release workflow, and will grow a macOS block when
  the in-progress macOS port ships. QEMU itself is not bundled;
  `brew info vm-curator` covers the runtime notes.
- **Fix VMs Failing to Launch with a Relative Library Path** (#79): Entering a
  relative path like `VMs` at the first-run prompt stored it verbatim, so
  discovery depended on the directory vm-curator was started from — and
  launching always failed with
  `bash: VMs/<vm>/launch.sh: No such file or directory` (the launcher changes
  into the VM directory, double-resolving the relative path). Paths entered in
  the setup prompt and Settings now expand `~` and anchor bare relative paths at
  your home directory, a relative `--library` CLI flag resolves against the
  current directory at startup, and existing configs with relative or
  `~`-prefixed paths self-heal on load — affected users are fixed by upgrading.

**v1.3.0**

- Both features in this release come from
  [@HenriqueCrj](https://github.com/HenriqueCrj) — thank you!
- **Configurable VM Window Size** (thanks @HenriqueCrj, #67): New **Default
  Window Size** entry in Settings sets the initial display resolution for
  launched VMs (`WIDTHxHEIGHT`, e.g. `1440x900`; leave empty or enter `none` to
  keep each VM's own default). Sizes are validated to 320–16384 × 200–16384.
  - The size is passed to `launch.sh` via a `VM_CURATOR_WINDOW_SIZE` environment
    variable rather than baked into the script: the script's new video block
    applies it as `xres=`/`yres=` properties on the video device at runtime, so
    changing the setting affects the next launch of every VM without rewriting
    scripts, and launching a script by hand (no env var) behaves exactly as
    before.
  - Applies to vm-curator-generated scripts using standard VGA, `virtio-vga`,
    `virtio-vga-gl`, or QXL video. New VMs emit the override block at creation;
    existing supported scripts are patched idempotently on launch. Scripts with
    unsupported or hand-mixed video setups are deliberately left untouched.
- **Fix Shared Folder Argument Handling** (#66): Shared folders whose host path
  contains spaces or quotes produced a broken launch script — the 9p arguments
  were stored in a flat `SHARED_FOLDERS_ARGS="…"` string that the shell
  word-split at expansion. The managed section is now a properly quoted bash
  array expanded as `"${SHARED_FOLDERS_ARGS[@]}"`. Old-format scripts still
  parse, removal cleans up both forms, and single-GPU passthrough script
  extraction understands the array syntax too.
- **Fix USB Passthrough Being Passed as Script Options** (#66): Launching from
  the TUI with USB devices selected appended raw QEMU flags
  (`-usb -device usb-host,…`) as _shell arguments_ to `launch.sh` — which the
  script's option parser does not understand — instead of relying on the USB
  section persisted inside the script. Launch now uses only the persisted
  section (runtime devices are ignored with a logged warning), so what you save
  with `s` on the USB screen is exactly what boots.
- **Fix UEFI Boot Delays from Stale NVRAM Boot Entries** (#66): OVMF preserves
  guest-created NVRAM boot entries, so a guest that once registered PXE/HTTP
  network boot could delay every subsequent boot while the firmware tried the
  network first. Normal UEFI disk boots now pin the disk first —
  `-global virtio-blk-pci.bootindex=0` with `-boot strict=on` for virtio disks,
  `-boot order=c,strict=on` otherwise. Install, CD-ROM, recovery, and floppy
  boots are unaffected (and the floppy branch now explicitly requests
  `-boot a`).
- **Keep Management Screens Open When Saving Fails** (#66): Choosing **Save** in
  the unsaved-changes prompt on the USB Passthrough, PCI Passthrough, or Shared
  Folders screens now keeps the screen open when the save fails (e.g. an
  unwritable `launch.sh`) instead of closing anyway and silently losing the
  selections.

**v1.2.3**

- **Hide-KVM Toggle for Single-GPU Passthrough — AMD Included** (#71, continuing
  #60): Windows guests on modern AMD cards (reported on an RX 9070 XT)
  black-screened or hit driver Code 43 even with a vBIOS ROM set, because AMD's
  RDNA3/4 Windows drivers — like NVIDIA's — misbehave when they detect a
  hypervisor. The generated single-GPU scripts already hid KVM from the guest
  (`-cpu host,kvm=off,hv_vendor_id=…` plus Hyper-V enlightenments), but only for
  NVIDIA GPUs.
  - The hypervisor-hiding CPU flags are now controlled by a per-VM **Hide KVM**
    setting: shown in the Single GPU Setup screen, toggled with `[h]`, persisted
    in `single-gpu-config.toml` alongside the vBIOS ROM, and **on by default for
    both NVIDIA and AMD** GPUs.
  - Configs written by earlier versions lack the setting and pick up the vendor
    default on load; regenerate the scripts with `[g]` to apply it. For AMD
    _Linux_ guests the only cost of the new default is losing KVM paravirt
    niceties such as kvmclock (the guest still runs KVM-accelerated) — toggle it
    off if you prefer those.
- **Fix App Quitting When Typing 'q' in Settings** (#72): Setting a value
  containing the letter `q` (e.g. a VM Library Path like `~/qemu-vms`) in the
  Settings editor quit the program mid-keystroke. The global `q`-to-quit handler
  exempted every screen that accepts free text except the Settings screen's
  inline edit mode, so it consumed the key before the edit buffer saw it.
  `q`/`Q` now type normally while editing a value; `q` still quits when just
  browsing the settings list.

**v1.2.2**

- **Fix VM Launch Failure in Library Paths Containing Spaces** (#65): VMs
  created with v1.0.0–v1.2.1 failed to launch when the VM library path contained
  a space (e.g. `/mnt/Virtual SSD/Virtualmachines`) — QEMU aborted with
  `-qmp unix:/mnt/Virtual: Failed to connect to '/mnt/Virtual': No such file or directory`.
  The generated `launch.sh` wrote the QMP monitor socket path unquoted — the
  only unquoted path interpolation in the script — so the shell word-split the
  argument at the space. VMs created with v0.4.10 or earlier were unaffected
  because they predate the QMP socket line.
  - Newly generated scripts quote the socket path (`unix:"$VM_DIR/qemu.sock"`),
    matching how `$DISK`, `$ISO`, and the other paths are already quoted.
  - Existing broken scripts self-heal: on launch, vm-curator rewrites the
    unquoted form in place (idempotently), so affected VMs work again without
    re-creating them or hand-editing `launch.sh`. This repair runs on the TUI
    launch path as well as CLI launches.

**v1.2.1**

- **Raw Disk Image Support** (thanks @HenriqueCrj, #55): The VM creation
  wizard's disk step now offers a qcow2/raw format toggle for new disks, with
  honest trade-off labels (raw disks don't support snapshots).
  - Existing and imported disks keep their real format: it is detected via
    `qemu-img info` (falling back to the file extension), the disk file is named
    to match (`vm.raw` vs `vm.qcow2`), and generated launch scripts emit the
    matching `format=` argument instead of hardcoding qcow2.
  - The disk file browser now also lists `.raw` and `.img` images.
- **Prevent Passed-Through GPUs Getting Stuck in D3cold** (#60): On modern AMD
  boot GPUs (reported on an RX 9070 XT), vfio-pci's runtime power management
  could idle the passed-through GPU into D3cold and fail to wake it — QEMU
  aborts with `vfio: Unable to power on device, stuck in D3`, and the host
  display cannot be restored without a reboot. The `/etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf`
  written by System Setup now sets
  `options vfio_pci disable_vga=1 disable_idle_d3=1` (the standard fix; the only
  cost is slightly higher idle power on passed-through devices). Existing
  single-GPU users should re-run System Setup from Settings → Single GPU
  Passthrough to pick up the new option.
- **Fix Host Hang / Power-Off in Single-GPU Passthrough on APUs** (#61):
  Launching the generated `single-gpu-start.sh` could hard-hang or power the
  machine off entirely — reported on a Ryzen 7735U (Radeon 680M) mini PC. The
  script stopped the display manager and unloaded the GPU driver while fbcon was
  still rendering the active TTY through the GPU; the silent `modprobe -r`
  failure then led to force-unbinding an in-use driver, which AMD APUs in
  particular do not survive.
  - The start script now detaches the framebuffer virtual consoles
    (`/sys/class/vtconsole/*/bind`) and the generic EFI/simple framebuffer
    before unloading the GPU driver — the standard single-GPU passthrough
    sequence that was missing.
  - If the GPU driver still refuses to unload, the script aborts gracefully
    (cleanup restores the display) instead of force-unbinding an in-use driver.
  - Cleanup skips the PCI remove/rescan teardown when the GPU never left its
    original driver (the abort path), and both cleanup and
    `single-gpu-restore.sh` reattach the EFI framebuffer and virtual consoles so
    the TTY comes back.
  - Integrated GPUs (APUs) are now detected (best-effort, via a known AMD APU
    device-ID list plus Intel's fixed `00:02.0` iGPU address) and flagged with a
    prominent warning in the Single GPU Setup screen and the generated script
    header: APU passthrough is best-effort, and guest video requires a vBIOS
    extracted from that machine's own BIOS image.

**v1.2.0**

- **Security: bump `quick-xml` to 0.41** (RUSTSEC-2026-0194, RUSTSEC-2026-0195):
  resolves two high-severity advisories (quadratic-time duplicate-attribute
  check and unbounded namespace-declaration allocation) in the libvirt-XML
  import parser. Also bumps `anyhow` to 1.0.103.
- **Fix Windows 11 TPM 2.0 Detection on Fedora** (#42): Windows 11 VMs created
  with TPM enabled failed the installer's "PC must support TPM 2.0" check on
  Fedora 44, because vm-curator selected the 2M `OVMF_CODE.secboot.fd` firmware,
  which does not expose TPM 2.0 correctly.
  - OVMF firmware is now chosen as a matched CODE+VARS **pair**
    (`find_ovmf_firmware`), preferring 4M builds — including Fedora's
    qcow2-format firmware (`OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.qcow2`) — over 2M, with the 2M
    variants kept only as a last-resort fallback. Picking CODE and VARS from one
    pair guarantees they always agree in size and on-disk format.
  - The pflash `-drive` lines now emit `format=qcow2` or `format=raw` to match
    the selected firmware instead of a hardcoded `format=raw`, so qcow2 firmware
    actually works. Applies to both the standard and single-GPU-passthrough
    launch scripts.
  - Generated launch scripts now create a per-user swtpm CA config
    (`swtpm_setup --create-config-files skip-if-exist`) so EK/platform
    certificate creation no longer needs write access to the system-wide
    `/var/lib/swtpm-localca`, and fall back to a certificate-less swtpm setup if
    cert creation still fails. The single-GPU-passthrough TPM setup was brought
    to parity (previously missing `--overwrite` and the certificate handling).
- **Warn Before Discarding Passthrough / Shared-Folder Changes** (#52): On the
  USB Passthrough, PCI Passthrough, and Shared Folders management screens,
  selections are saved with `s` while `Esc` exits — so users who toggled a
  device and pressed `Esc` (expecting it to persist) silently lost their
  changes, and the device was never passed through.
  - Leaving any of these three screens with unsaved changes now shows a
    three-way prompt — **Save (s) / Discard (d) / Cancel (Esc)** — instead of
    silently discarding. Choosing Save persists to `launch.sh` (so the change
    applies on next boot) and returns; Discard leaves without saving; Cancel
    stays on the screen.
  - Unsaved-change detection compares against the selection captured on entry
    (and refreshed after each save), so a previously saved but now-disconnected
    USB/PCI device does not register as a spurious change.
  - On the USB and PCI screens, `Space` is now the sole toggle and `Enter` saves
    (alongside `s`). Previously both `Space` and `Enter` toggled, so selecting a
    device with `Space` and pressing `Enter` to "confirm" toggled it back off —
    exactly the reporter's flow.
- **Fix Single-GPU Passthrough Script Bugs on AMD + NVIDIA** (#58): The
  generated single-GPU passthrough script contained two crash-inducing bugs.
  - It could include the primary host bridge (`0000:00:00.0`) — or another
    infrastructure device sharing the GPU's IOMMU group — in `EXTRA_PCI_ADDRS`
    and try to bind it to `vfio-pci`, which the kernel rejects with "Invalid
    argument", aborting the script. Infrastructure devices (host/PCI bridges,
    etc.) are now excluded from the PCI passthrough selection list and filtered
    out of `EXTRA_PCI_ADDRS` at generation time (the host bridge is dropped
    unconditionally as a safety net).
  - Even though single-GPU mode emits `-display none -vga none`, the extracted
    QEMU command still carried an emulated graphics device (e.g.
    `-device virtio-vga-gl` from the 3D-acceleration feature), so QEMU aborted
    on launch. The extractor now strips emulated graphics devices
    (`virtio-vga-gl`, `virtio-vga`, `qxl`, `VGA`, etc.) alongside the existing
    `-display`/`-vga` removal, since the passed-through physical GPU drives the
    display.
- **GPU vBIOS ROM support for Single-GPU Passthrough** (#44): AMD single-GPU
  passthrough commonly produces no video in the guest because the passed-through
  card has no clean vBIOS — the host already POSTed it. You can now point the
  Single GPU Setup screen at a vBIOS ROM file (`[r]` to set, `[R]` to clear);
  when set, the generated script passes the GPU with `romfile="…"`. The setting
  is persisted in the single-GPU config and shown in the setup screen.
  - The setup screen and generated script now warn that AMD GPUs usually need a
    vBIOS ROM to output video, and that integrated (APU) GPUs are often
    unsupported for passthrough.
  - Note: this enables the standard AMD fix but cannot guarantee success on all
    hardware — APU passthrough in particular may remain unsupported regardless
    of a supplied ROM.

**v1.1.0**

- **SPICE Clipboard Sharing** (#41): VMs using the `spice-app` display now
  support bidirectional host ⇄ guest copy/paste out of the box. vm-curator
  emitted `-display spice-app` but never the SPICE guest-agent channel that
  `spice-vdagent` talks over, so clipboard sharing silently did nothing even
  with the agent installed in the guest.
  - New VMs automatically emit the guest-agent channel
    (`-device virtio-serial-pci`,
    `-chardev spicevmc,id=spicechannel0,name=vdagent`,
    `-device virtserialport,...com.redhat.spice.0`) — the same args virt-manager
    adds by default
  - `SPICE_AGENT_ARGS` is the single source of truth; a new
    `set_spice_agent_args()` adds/removes the channel when toggling display
    backends on existing VMs
  - Requires `spice-vdagent` installed in the guest
- **Fix `-qmp` Crash in Single-GPU Passthrough** (#48): Single-GPU passthrough
  VMs created on v1.0.0 failed to launch with
  `-qmp -device: '-device' is not a valid char driver` after binding the GPU to
  `vfio-pci`, then dropped back to the desktop.
  - `extract_qemu_command_for_passthrough()` appended passthrough args by
    splitting at the command's last backslash and discarding the remainder.
    Since v1.0.0 appends the QMP socket as the final argument with its value on
    its own continuation line, this dropped the socket value and left `-qmp`
    dangling in front of `-device vfio-pci`
  - The same flawed logic also silently dropped the final argument (e.g. the
    network device) of any passthrough command
  - Replaced with `append_passthrough_args()`, which strips only a trailing
    continuation backslash and appends after the complete command, preserving
    the QMP value; added regression tests
- **Fix Stray AppImage Release Asset** (#46): The `build-appimage` CI job
  globbed `*.AppImage` when uploading, publishing the downloaded
  `appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage` alongside the real artifact. Scoped the upload
  glob to `vm-curator-*.AppImage` so only our AppImage ships.

**v1.0.0**

- **First stable release.** Many thanks to
  [@indyfive11](https://github.com/indyfive11) for the library-API contributions
  below! Beyond those, this release focuses on release-engineering and
  code-hardening rather than new end-user features; existing TUI behavior is
  unchanged.
- **Library target for GUI/external consumers** (thanks @indyfive11, #39): adds
  a `[lib]` target exposing the business-logic modules (`commands`, `config`,
  `fs`, `hardware`, `metadata`, `vm`, `wizard_types`) via `lib.rs`, with the
  `ui` (ratatui/crossterm) module intentionally excluded. Wizard/import state
  types were extracted into a front-end-agnostic `wizard_types` module. Also
  adds QMP-based VM control (pause/resume) and a D-Bus display launch path for
  GUI embedding.
- **Detect immediate QEMU startup failures in D-Bus launch** (thanks
  @indyfive11, #40): `launch_vm_dbus` now polls `try_wait()` after 300ms (the
  same pattern as `launch_vm_with_error_check`) so a QEMU process that exits
  instantly — no session bus, an unrecognized flag, a missing shared library —
  surfaces an error with QEMU's stderr instead of returning a PID a GUI consumer
  would wait on forever.
- **CI quality gates** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): every push to `main` and
  every pull request now runs `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings`, `cargo test --locked`, and
  `cargo audit`. Previously nothing ran tests or lints before a release tag was
  cut.
- **Toolchain pin**: added `rust-toolchain.toml` (stable + clippy/rustfmt) so
  local, contributor, and CI builds agree; dropped the unenforced "Rust 1.70+"
  MSRV claim from the README.
- **Lint clean-up**: added `#![warn(clippy::all)]` and fixed all clippy findings
  under `-D warnings`; the whole codebase is now `cargo fmt`-clean.
- **Expanded test coverage**: new tests for `qemu-img` disk-format JSON parsing
  and for `Config` load/save (round-trip, partial/malformed TOML), via new
  path-parameterized `Config::load_from`/`save_to` helpers.
- **Import parser refactor**: the ~360-line libvirt XML parser was split into a
  small state struct with focused per-event/element helpers;
  behavior-preserving, with added regression tests.
- **Documentation**: crate-level public-API docs on the library root, module
  docs for the app state machine and UI dispatcher, and clarifying comments on
  intentional future-API `dead_code`; `cargo doc` is warning-free.

**v0.4.10**

- **First release with external contributions** — many thanks to
  [@Ibn-Hesham](https://github.com/Ibn-Hesham) and
  [@nextzard](https://github.com/nextzard) for the patches below!
- **Nix Flake** (thanks @Ibn-Hesham, #32): Reproducible builds and dev shell.
  Adds `flake.nix` with `packages.default`, `devShells.default`, and
  `apps.default` outputs, plus a `flake.lock`. README updated with Nix/NixOS
  installation instructions. Build artifacts excluded via `.gitignore`.
- **Fix Snapshots on UEFI VMs** (thanks @nextzard, #33 / #37): `primary_disk()`
  returned the first parsed `-drive` line, which on UEFI VMs is the read-only
  `OVMF_CODE.fd` pflash entry — `qemu-img snapshot` then failed with
  `Permission denied` against the firmware blob
  - `primary_disk()` now picks the first disk whose format supports snapshots
    (qcow2), falling back to `disks.first()` for legacy/non-qcow2 cases
  - Fix applies to all snapshot entry points (CLI, TUI, lifecycle)
- **Fix Network-Settings Rewrite** (#36, #38): Editing model/backend/MAC on an
  existing VM via the Network Settings screen had two compounding bugs in
  `update_network_in_script`:
  - Replacement args were inserted only at the first match (`--install` branch),
    leaving `--cdrom`, `--recovery`, `--floppy`, and normal-boot branches with
    no networking at all
  - The line-strip loop consumed every backslash-continued line from `-netdev`
    through the next non-`\` line, sweeping up adjacent non-network args
    (`-usb`, `-device usb-tablet`, `-rtc base=localtime`)
  - Rewrite now consumes only contiguous network-arg lines and inserts the
    replacement in every branch; regression tests cover the bug, the
    `model = "none"` strip path, and the originally-no-network fallback
- **Fix Wizard Hidden-Row Navigation** (#31): In the create wizard's "Configure
  QEMU" step, network sub-rows are conditionally rendered based on Network / Net
  Backend settings, but keyboard arrows still walked the full static field range
  — letting users focus invisible rows and open hidden editors (Net Backend /
  Bridge / Forwards / MAC)
  - Visibility rules consolidated on `QemuField::is_visible`; Up/Down
    navigation, Tab/Enter/`g`/`c` action handlers, Left/Right cycling, and the
    `r` profile-reset path all route through it
  - 10 unit tests pin the visibility truth table, skip navigation, bound
    conditions, and focus snap behavior

**v0.4.9**

- **Fix Port-Forward Editor Rendering**: Pressing Enter on the create wizard's
  "Forwards:" field activated the editor handler, but no popup was drawn — input
  went to an invisible target. Adds an overlay over step 4 with a rules list
  (plus presets) and an add-rule prompt, mirroring the existing network settings
  editor.
- **Fix Display Backend Parser**: `qemu-system-* -display help` output ends with
  a usage paragraph after the backend list, which slipped past the old filter
  and contributed bogus "backends" like "Some", "-display", and "For" to the
  wizard's display option cycler
  - Parse only the block between the "Available …:" header and the first blank
    line
  - Validate each token looks like a backend name (lowercase letters, digits,
    hyphens)
  - Unit tests added against real QEMU 10.x output

**v0.4.8**

- **MAC Address Editing**: Set an explicit MAC address on a VM's NIC, or
  generate a random one using QEMU's `52:54:00` OUI prefix
  - New `vm::mac` module for generation and validation
  - Editable in the create wizard and existing-VM network settings
  - Parsed from `launch.sh` on import so existing VMs round-trip correctly
- **Default ISO Path Setting**: ISO file browser now seeds to a configurable
  directory instead of always starting from `$HOME`
  - Settable from the Settings screen, or via `[d]` from inside the file browser
    to make the current directory the default
- **3D Acceleration Toggle**: New management menu item "3D Acceleration
  (non-pass-through)" on existing VMs toggles para-virtualized 3D
  (`virtio-vga-gl` + `gl=on`)
  - Automatically swaps `gtk` → `sdl` display when enabling, since SDL gives
    better performance for `gl=on`
  - Distinct from the GPU passthrough options to avoid confusion

**v0.4.7**

- **Windows Server Profiles**: Add 9 Windows Server OS profiles spanning two
  decades of Microsoft's server platform
  - Versions: 2003, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022, 2025
  - QEMU configurations mirror each version's desktop kernel counterpart (XP
    through Windows 11) with server-appropriate resources
  - New "Windows Server" subcategory under the Microsoft family in the hierarchy
  - Full metadata with descriptions, release dates, and fun facts for each
    version
  - ASCII art automatically uses the Windows fallback logo

**v0.4.6**

- **Fix Multi-GPU Passthrough VFIO Binding**: Launch scripts now automatically
  bind PCI devices to the `vfio-pci` driver before starting QEMU, and restore
  original drivers on VM exit
  - Fixes `Could not open '/dev/vfio/N': No such file or directory` error when
    launching VMs with GPU passthrough
  - Uses `pkexec` (polkit) for graphical authentication, with `sudo` fallback —
    only prompts when devices need rebinding
  - Skips binding entirely if devices are already on `vfio-pci` (e.g.,
    persistent kernel parameter setup)
  - Original drivers are restored on VM exit via cached sudo credentials or
    pkexec
  - Prerequisites dialog updated with VFIO binding info and permission
    requirements

**v0.4.5**

- **Fix Multi-GPU Passthrough State**: Multi-GPU Passthrough screen now
  correctly shows previously selected GPUs instead of always displaying "No GPU
  Selected"
